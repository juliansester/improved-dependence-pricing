## Abstract
We show how using inter-asset dependence information can lead to improved
model-free price bounds for multi-asset derivatives written on these assets. To establish these
improved price bounds we first derive inter-asset dependence information from observed market
prices of liquidly traded options and then use, in dependence of the type of the observed
liquidly traded option, either extracted correlation information or the concept of copulas and
quasi-copulas to model the arising inter-asset dependence restrictions. To compute the resultant
price bounds for some multi-asset options of interest we apply a modified martingale
optimal transport approach. In particular, we derive an adjusted pricing-hedging duality. To
provide further evidence for the relevance and tractability of our approach we illustrate the
improvement of resultant price bounds in several examples, which also cover real market data.
